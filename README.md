# video-rack
  Controller software for an Audio/Video switch used to switch video sources two two independent outputs. Selection is displayed on an I2C SSD1306 OLED
  display. Hardware is capable of 8 input, 2 outputs. Not all are used here.

  The reference to 405 lines is due to that output feeding a 625 line PAL to 405 Line system A standards converter.

  Hardware details can be found on my website at www.andydoz.blogspot.com
